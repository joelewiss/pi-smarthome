# Pi-Smarthome
*A Python-based web action executor*

## Okay, so what does it actually do?
It lets you execute python functions by making an HTTP request

## How can I use it?
The current modules are setup for devices around my home, but
anyone can take the code and write their own modules.

## Future improvements
- Methods accept arguments from HTTP body
- Multiple nodes with mesh networking
